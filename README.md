Welcome to the documentation of our Python library for estimating graphons from observed data! Our library provides a powerful set of tools for estimating graphons, which are a type of object used to model large, random graphs, from observed data.

```python
from pygraphon import HistogramEstimator

#  sample a graph with n nodes from one of the built-in graphons f(x,y) = x*y
from pygraphon import graphon_graphon_product
A = graphon_product.draw(n = 100)

# Create a histogram estimator
estimator = HistogramEstimator()

# Fit the estimator to a graph with adjacency matrix A
estimator.fit(A)

# Get the estimated graphon
graphon_estimated = estimator.get_graphon()

# get the estimated block connectivity matrix
theta = graphon_estimated.get_theta()

# get the estimated edge probability matrix
P_estimated = graphon_estimated.get_edge_connectivity()
```

## 🛠️ For Developers

<details>
	<summary>See developer instructions</summary>


The final section of the README is for if you want to get involved by making a code contribution.

### ❓ Testing

After cloning the repository and installing `tox` with `pip install tox`, the unit tests in the `tests/` folder can be
run reproducibly with:

```shell
$ tox -q 
```

Additionally, these tests are automatically re-run with each commit in a [GitHub Action](https://github.com//pygraphon/actions?query=workflow%3ATests).

### 📝 Documentation

The documentation is built with [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/). After installing the package in development mode, the documentation can be built locally with:

```shell
$ tox -e docs
```

The documentation will then be available in `.tox/tmp/build/html/`.


Another way to build the documentation is to use the `make` command:

```shell
$ cd docs
$ make html
```

The documentation will then be available in `docs/build/html/`. To use the `make` command, one needs to install the
*additional* necessary dependencies in the virutal environment. This can be done with:

```shell
$ pip install -r docs/requirements.txt
```

note: to correctly format the documentation, one can use tool such as `rstfmt` (installable with `pip install rstfmt`).
